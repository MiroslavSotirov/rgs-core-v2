dealing with failed or pending transactions:
player launches game (failure anywhere in the previous gameplay)-- Auth request : we don't get the actual transaction info in this response, only the last_game_status, so if we got -1 we'd have to do an additional call to get the last tx to know exactly how to handle it, what to display in the client (i.e. show the previous spin or not) and then we'd have to send from 1 to 3 transaction requests as well to close out the round before sending the response to the client, which might even result in an error again so the player wouldn't be able to launch the game.
the three possibilities for the type of tx that had failed are:

wager : retry the wager with a new ID . if we're going to scrap the wager and calculate a new game round, we have to do yet another query request to get the previous game round on which to calculate this game round (i.e. imagine we are in the middle of free spins, we would lose one of the freespin rounds if we didn't do this)
payout : retry with same ID. is there no chance we have the same problem as before where we're perpetually failing the transaction because of some deterministic error?
endround : agree we can just ignore this and manually clean up open rounds if they are reported

player clicks spin (failure on the previous endround tx)-- Query request : we can just start the new round, some operators might take issue with that but we can just manually clean up any game rounds that haven't been marked closed after a while

tx calls (wager, payout, endround): I guess we would never get this kind of response in the transaction call because instead we would have gotten an error on the previous spin and been forced to reload the page, and by the time we get to the tx call we've already processed the results of the auth call
