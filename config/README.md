CONFIG FILES
============

Configs must be completed to allow local development of the project, however the config files contained here do not enter the dev, staging, or production builds and therefore changing values here wil not have any effect on the versions of the rgs running in any of those environments.

In order to update the values in dev, staging, or prod, the values file in the rgs-builder repo must be updated for the relevant environment.
